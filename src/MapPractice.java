     * Usage tip!
     * 
     * Maps are great when you want a specific key to value mapping.
     * Example: The key could be a person's name, and the value could be their phone number
     * 
     * However if your keys are simple ascending 0-indexed integers with no gaps
     * (0, 1, 2, 3, 4...) then an array or List is likely a better choice.
     * Example: If you want to store the order of songs in a playlist.
     * 
     * If you're finding that you're just wanting to store unordered values and the keys
     * are unimportant, a Set may be a better choice.
     * Example: If you want to hold the student ID numbers of everyone in a course,
     * and you don't care about any ordering.
